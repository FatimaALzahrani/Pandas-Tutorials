# Pandas Methods Tutorial Sites

This repository contains two interactive websites designed to explain advanced `pandas` methods for data analysis in Python. The websites provide practical examples, code snippets, and outputs to help users understand key concepts.

---

## Websites Overview:

### 1. Compare Between `concat()`, `merge()`, and `join()`
- This website provides an in-depth comparison of the three commonly used methods for combining data in `pandas`:
  - `concat()`: Used to concatenate DataFrames along rows or columns.
  - `merge()`: Used to combine DataFrames based on common keys or indices.
  - `join()`: Used to combine DataFrames on their indices.
- **Features:**
  - Code examples with syntax highlighting.
  - Interactive output visualization.
  - Explanations of when to use each method.

### 2. GroupBy Methods: `aggregate()`, `filter()`, `transform()`, and `apply()`
- This website explains the advanced methods available for `GroupBy` objects:
  - `aggregate()`: Apply multiple aggregation functions (e.g., `sum`, `mean`).
  - `filter()`: Filter groups based on conditions.
  - `transform()`: Transform data to return a DataFrame with the same shape.
  - `apply()`: Apply custom functions to groups.
- **Features:**
  - Tutorials with detailed explanations.
  - Example code with expected outputs.
  - Scenarios for applying each method.
